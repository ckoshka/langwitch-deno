- this isn't maintained anymore
- it still builds and works just fine, weirdly, for whatever reason. i'm not used to projects still working after two-ish years of inactivity but that's nix for ya
- but it is also excruciatingly slow. i think this is because one of the dependencies changed and there's a pointless allocate-deallocate loop going on in the middle of an async generator (yeesh) and v8 is sensibly deoptimising it.
- not important though

- what *is* important:
- i think our current approach towards spaced repetition is fundamentally solving the wrong problem, and i am trying to find the right problem so i can make something better.

- most of the code in this repository is abstraction spaghetti, honestly don't even bother
- the only neat thing is https://archive.org/download/english-portuguese-statmt
- (contains an ungodly amount of high-quality translation data, not just portuguese)
- (also doesn't download anything. it's a static list)

### The what

- Langwitch is an experimental language learning tool for power users.
- It can teach you any language from scratch with just a collection of sentences and their translations.
- Or, alternatively, any writing system from scratch with just a collection of words and their IPA transcriptions.
- It comes with 25 billion high-quality sentences mined across 1700 languages using a combination of traditional heuristic filtering and automatically curated neural machine translation.

### The how

#### From a type-level perspective

- Langwitch has a sound, declarative plugin architecture expressed as a polymorphic effect system using commutative monoids. The application itself is a free monad.
- Every part of Langwitch is implemented in terms of this architecture, meaning anything can be freely substituted via configuration without forking the source code.

#### From an algorithmic perspective

- There are three core algorithms that Langwitch uses. All of them are simple, easy to reason about, and completely parameterised.
- Langwitch is quite fast. I have a very low tolerance threshold for slow interfaces. My personal Portuguese collection has 13 million sentences and it boots within five seconds; once the session has loaded, each topological reordering requires between 0.5ms and 5ms. 

### The why

It really bothers me how slow, boring, and useless normal language-learning is. 

You have textbooks having you memorise stock phrases like "How do you do?" or "I would like a coffee", Duolingo courses that make you learn names of furtniture, universities that hand out photocopies of verb declension worksheets.

It's a really appalling situation. 

About a year ago, I wondered whether the process could be optimised. I was hoping for something maybe 10 to 50% faster, maybe shaving a few weeks off the process. 

From testing with early adopters over the last year, it seems like the difference isn't 15 to 20% faster, but 10 to 50 times faster – often compressing weeks into a few hours. It's not that Langwitch does anything special or unique, it's simply that most other methods are just very bad, reflecting the intuitions of 19th century pedagogy rather than modern cognitive linguistics.

### The who

Here are some cases where you might want to use or extend Langwitch.

* You want something hackable, not a glib monolithic interface that assumes you're too incompetent to customise anything
* You enjoy trying out experimental prototypes
* You're frustrated, bored, or confused when it comes to "normal" second-language acquisition
* You get a kick out of pushing yourself, measuring yourself, and continually breaking new records
    * Langwitch includes a suite of tools that allow you to perform statistical analysis and detailed instrumentation of your own performance
* You like to solve puzzles

Here are some cases where Langwitch might not be right for you.

* You prefer to have everything explicitly put in front of you. 
    * Langwitch does not tell you what each word translates to, it allows you to infer its full meaning from its context. It doesn't teach you grammatical rules either – it's a tango between subconscious absorption and conscious puzzle-solving.
* You need extrinsic motivation in the form of levelling up, streaks, virtual currencies, and stores.
    * That's okay. Langwitch has those as opt-ins. But it's really meant for people who prefer to define their own goals, their own metrics, and their own successes.
* You have your own method and it works just fine for you.
    * In that case, Langwitch might be useful as an adjunct for your current method, but you know best.

## Installation

### Requirements

- [nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) - ``sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon``
    * **How long will it take?** Under 10 minutes
    * **How likely is it to fail?** Unlikely, but possible. Try ``sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --no-daemon`` if it doesn't work the first time.
    * **What does it do?** It's a package manager powerful enough to install other package managers, with guaranteed reproducible builds. It does this in an isolated way.

If nix fails to build for some reason (this is rare but it does happen), you're in luck. Langwitch can build without nix if you have:

* [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) - ``curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh``
    * **How long will it take?** 15-20 mins if I'm remembering right
    * **How likely is it to fail?** Pretty unlikely. 
    * **What does it do?** It's the package manager for Rust, and it does a few other things besides
* [deno](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation) - ``curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh``
    * **How long will it take?** 3-7 seconds, depending on your internet speed
    * **How likely is it to fail?** It just doesn't. Seriously.
    * **What does it do?** It's a package manager for Javascript and Typescript. It does its job very, very well.
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - there's no script, it's just a simple download
    * **How long will it take?** I have no idea
    * **How likely is it to fail?** Probably won't, again, I have no idea
    * **What does it do?** A lot of things, but here we're just using it to copy over some files.

If you would like audio to be enabled, and you don't have nix, you can add [mpv](https://mpv.io/) which is a command-line music-player.

If you haven't done anything like this before, these commands are meant to be typed into a terminal. On Windows, it's called Windows Terminal. On OSX, it's called Terminal. You get the gist.

### Important notes

Langwitch doesn't pollute your environment.

The build-step creates some Rust binaries, adds some example configuration files for you to tweak, then it's done.

Langwitch itself is a self-contained script run in an isolated Nix shell. You just need to choose where you want it to live.

Lastly, you need some sentences for it to draw from. By default, it can download at most 5 million sentences covering equal proportions of everything available. If you have more than 4 CPU cores, have lots of storage, or you're willing to put up with a longer boot period, I have tried it with 45 million sentences and it worked fine.

It has general datasets covering the internet, UN transcripts, movie dialogue, novels, Wikipedia, scientific journals, news articles, and plenty of other genres. It also has topics covering specialised technical vocabulary. 

See if any pique your interest. You can browse the high-resource directory [here](https://archive.org/download/english-portuguese-statmt) and the low-resource directory [here](https://archive.org/download/bible_alignments_v2) while the installer is running. I've been doing this by myself so far. I would love it if you had anything to contribute! Open up an issue if you do.

Please be careful to weed out any topics you're not interested in. Someone I know was stuck learning about pottery because the pottery dataset is around six times larger than the others (250,000 sentences).
